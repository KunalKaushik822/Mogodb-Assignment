    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database management system. Unlike relational databases (SQL databases) that rely on a fixed table structure with rows and columns, MongoDB uses a flexible document-oriented structure. Documents store data in JSON-like format, allowing for more diverse and evolving data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-Relational Databases offer a different approach to data storage compared to traditional SQL databases. Here's a quick breakdown of the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structure:\n",
    "# SQL: Structured data in fixed tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "# NoSQL: Flexible data structures like documents, graphs, or key-value pairs.\n",
    "# Schema:\n",
    "# SQL: Predefined schema defining data types and relationships.\n",
    "# NoSQL: Schema-less or flexible schema allowing for adaptability.\n",
    "# Scaling:\n",
    "# SQL: Can be vertically scalable (adding more processing power).\n",
    "# NoSQL: Often excels in horizontal scalability (adding more machines).\n",
    "# When to Use MongoDB over SQL Databases?\n",
    "# Here are some scenarios where MongoDB might be a better choice than a traditional SQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Large, Evolving Data: When working with big data or data that frequently changes structure, MongoDB's flexible schema can adapt more easily.\n",
    "# Fast Inserts and Queries: MongoDB can excel in scenarios requiring frequent insertions and updates, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "# Hierarchical Data: Document-oriented structure can efficiently store hierarchical data with nested elements.\n",
    "# Distributed Data: MongoDB scales well horizontally, making it suitable for distributed data storage across multiple servers.\n",
    "# Polymorphic Data: When you have diverse data structures within a collection (like user profiles with varying fields), MongoDB can handle this well."

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Document-oriented Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, allowing for diverse data structures within a collection.\n",
    "# Documents can contain various data types, including arrays, embedded documents, and other complex structures.\n",
    "# Adapts well to evolving data models as new fields can be added to documents without altering the entire collection structure.\n",
    "# 2. Schema-less (or Flexible Schema):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Doesn't enforce a predefined schema like SQL databases.\n",
    "# Documents within a collection can have different structures as long as they share an identifier field.\n",
    "# Offers flexibility for storing data with varying attributes or adding new fields over time.\n",
    "# 3. Sharding:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enables horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple servers (shards).\n",
    "# Sharding improves performance for large datasets and allows you to scale your database capacity by adding more shards.\n",
    "# 4. Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Supports data replication for high availability and disaster recovery.\n",
    "# You can configure replica sets to maintain copies of your data on multiple servers, ensuring data remains accessible even if a server fails.\n",
    "# 5. Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Provides a powerful framework for performing complex data aggregations, grouping, and transformations directly within the database.\n",
    "# Eliminates the need for extensive data manipulation in your application code.\n",
    "# 6. Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Offers various indexing options to optimize query performance.\n",
    "# Indexes create references for specific fields, allowing for faster retrieval of documents based on frequently used queries.\n",
    "# 7. Caching:\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB can cache frequently accessed data in memory, further improving query performance and reducing disk I/O.\n",
    "# 8. ACID Transactions (since MongoDB 4.0):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Provides support for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) transactions for ensuring data integrity in specific operations.\n",
    "# 9. Ad-hoc Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Allows for flexible querying using a JSON-like query language.\n",
    "# You can query data based on specific fields, perform logical operations, and filter documents using various operators.\n",
    "# 10. Rich Developer Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Offers a variety of developer tools and drivers for various programming languages, simplifying development and interaction with the database."
